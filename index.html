            <h2>What this does</h2>
            <p>Finds the most likely tonic and whether it is Major or Minor based on the notes in your MIDI.</p>
            <h2>Only Major and Minor</h2>
            <p>For now, the detector only considers Major and Minor scales.</p>
            <h2>What are relative scales?</h2>
            <p>Major and its relative minor share all notes (e.g., C Major and A Minor all have C, D, E, F, G, A, B). Depending on which notes the melody leans more to, the detector may prefer one over the other.</p>
            <h2>What does "tonic" mean?</h2>
            <p>The tonic is the pitch everything feels drawn back to. Knowing the tonic instantly tells you the song's key, so you know which chords and melodies fit naturally.</p>
