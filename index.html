            <h2>What this does</h2>
            <p>Finds the most likely tonic and whether it is Major or Minor based on pitch-class usage in your MIDI.</p>
            <h2>Why did it say Major not Minor?</h2>
            <p>Major and its relative minor share notes (e.g., C Major and A Minor). If your melody leans to the shared notes, the detector may prefer the relative key.</p>
            <h2>What is the tonic?</h2>
            <p>The tonic is the home note of the key—the pitch everything feels resolved to. It's what you expect to hear at the end of a phrase.</p>
